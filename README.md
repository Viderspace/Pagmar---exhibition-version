# Pagmar - Exhibition Version

## Overview
**The Rabbit Hole** is an interactive installation developed as a final project for the Game Development program at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem & Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. 
This project provides the experience of hacking into a normal-looking payphone and transforming it into a fully functional synthesizer, merging the realms of physical computing, sound engineering, and game design. 

Utilizing the Unity Engine and a custom sound engine built in Reaktor, this installation explores the intersection of technology and creativity in an immersive, hands-on experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Synthesizer**: Transforms a standard payphone into an interactive synthesizer.
- **Unity Integration**: Utilizes Unity Engine to orchestrate interaction dynamics and sound manipulation.
- **Custom Sound Design**: Features a bespoke sound module designed with Reaktor, providing unique auditory feedback and interaction possibilities.

## Installation
To set up the installation locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viderspace/Pagmar---exhibition-version.git
```
2. Open the project in Unity (version 20XX.X or later recommended).
3. Ensure all dependencies, particularly related to Reaktor and any physical computing integrations, are correctly installed and configured.

## Usage
- Activate the installation by interacting with the payphone’s numerical pad.
- Different keys and sequences trigger various sound effects and synthesizer actions, allowing for a dynamic audio experience.

## Exhibitions and Accolades
- Featured in Bezalel's Graduate Exhibition.
- Praised as one of the most innovative projects by department heads at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Bezalel Academy.
